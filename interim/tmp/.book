Everyone had their burden to carry and cling to, and each of them wore his own form and special wounds.

I was ten years old old, when I climbed the first summit, the Sennalpstock, at its foot our village Nimikon is located. For the first time I saw the horrors and the beauties of the mountains. Deep gorges, full of ice and Snow-water, glacier-glaciers, terrible moray eels, and above all like a bell high and round the sky. If one for ten years lived between mountain and lake and narrow around high altitude he did not forget the day, for the first time there was a big, broad sky above him and an infinite horizon ahead of him.

Slowly and chatting we climbed one moderate hills, overlooked town, lake and gardens and enjoyed the whopping Beauty of the eve.</p>",
  "page-92": "<p>\"And yodel now!\" Shouted Richard. \"If you still feel embarrassed, so turn your back on me. But please, loud! \"</p><p>He could be satisfied. I yodelled angrily and exultantly into the rosy one Evening in, in all keys and refractions. When I stopped, he wanted to say something, but immediately paused again and pointed, listening against the mountains. From a distant height came answer, softly, drawn out and swelling, the greeting of a shepherd or wanderer, and we heard silently and happy too. During this common standing and listening overrun the sensation with a delicious shiver, for the first time beside one To be friends and two in beautiful, rosy, cloudy Lebensweiten to look. The evening lake began its soft play of colors and shortly before Sunset, I saw a few defiant, cheeky tears Jagged Alpine peaks stand out.</p>",
  "page-93": "<p>\"There is my home,\" I said. \"The middle ruff is the red one Fluh, right the Geishorn, left and further away the round Sennalpstock. I was ten years and three weeks old when I first met stood on this broad hilltop. \"</p><p>I strained my eyes to reach one of the more southerly peaks spot. After a while Richard said something I did not understand.</p><p>\"What did you say?\" I asked.</p><p>\"I say I know what art you're doing.\"</p><p>\"Which one?\"</p><p>\"You are a poet.\"</p><p>Then I blushed and annoyed and at the same time was astonished how he got that have guessed.</p>",
  "page-94": "<p>\"No,\" I cried, \"I am not a poet. I'm at school though Verses done, but not for a long time. \"</p><p>\"May I see you once?\"</p><p>\"They are burned. But you should not see her, even if I did she still had. \"</p><p>\"Certainly very modern things, with a lot of Nietzsche in it?\"</p><p>\"What's this?\"</p><p>\"Nietzsche? Yes, great God, do not you know him? \"</p><p>\"No. How should I know him? \"</p><p>Now he was delighted that I did not know Nietzsche. But I became annoyed and asked how much glacier he had already gone. As he said no, I was as mockingly amazed as he was before about me. Then he put his hand on my arm and said seriously, \"You are sensitive. But you do not know yourself what kind enviably unspoiled person You are and how few such are. You see, in a year or two you will be Nietzsche and all that stuff also know, much better than me, since you are more thorough and clever.</p>",
  "page-95": "<p> But just as you are now, I like you. You know Nietzsche not and Wagner not, but you have been a lot on snow mountains and have such a proficient Oberländergesicht. And you are certainly one too Poet. I can see that by the look and the forehead. \"</p><p>Also, that he looked at me so frankly and unabashedly and his Opinion, I was amazed and seemed unusual.</p><p>But I was even more astonished and happy when he was eight days later In a much visited beer garden brotherhood closed with me, above all People jumped up, kissed me and embraced me and mad with me like crazy Table danced around.</p>",
  "page-96": "<p>\"What will people think!\" I warned timidly.</p><p>\"They'll think: the two are extremely happy or whole extremely drunk; but most will think nothing. \"</p><p>Richard always seemed to me often, though he was older, smarter, better educated and, in general, was more shrewd and sophisticated than me, but in comparison to be the pure child with me. In the street he made adolescents Schoolgirl solemnly mocking the yard, the most serious piano pieces he interrupted unexpectedly with completely childish jokes, and as we once did For fun, he went into a church, he suddenly said in the middle thoughtful and important to me during the sermon: \"You do not think you is the pastor looking like a rabbit? \"The comparison was true, me but he found that he could have told me afterwards and told him the.</p>",
  "page-97": "<p>\"If it was right!\" He pouted. \"I'll have it until later probably forgotten again. \"</p><p>That his jokes were by no means always witty, often even just that Citizen of a bush-verse, disturbed neither me nor others, because what we loved and admired about him was not wit and spirit, but the indomitable serenity of his light, childlike nature, which burst forth at any moment and him with a light, cheerful Atmosphere surrounded. She could be in a gesture, in a soft laugh, in a cheerful look, but for a long time she could not hide. I'm sure he sometimes laughs or makes a gesture in his sleep had to do the merriment.</p><p>Richard often brought me together with other young people, students, Musicians, painters, writers, all kinds of foreigners, because what interesting, art-loving and distinctive people walked around town, got into his dealings.</p>",
  "page-98": "<p> There were some serious and violently wrestling spirits in the process, philosophers, aesthetes and socialists, and of many I could learn a good deal. Knowledge from various fields flew piece by piece, I supplemented and read a lot alongside, and so I won gradually a certain idea of ​​what the most active minds of the Time plagued and banished, and got a benevolent inspiring insight into the spiritual International. Your wishes, hunches, works and ideals I was attracted and understandable, without a strong own impulse would have compelled me to argue for or against. For most I found all the energy of thought and passion on states and Institutions of the society, the state, the sciences, the Arts, teaching methods, but few seemed to me that Need to know without building an external purpose on oneself and you clarify personal relationship to time and eternity. Also in myself This shoot was mostly half asleep.</p>",
  "page-99": "<p>I did not make any friendships anymore, since I exclusively and with Richard Jealousy loved. Even the women he dealt with a lot and I tried to escape him. The smallest met with him I was meticulous about appointments and sensitive when he met me let wait. Once he asked me to row him at a certain hour pick. I came but did not find him at home and waited three hours in vain for his coming. The next day I threw him his negligence fierce.</p><p>\"Why did not you go rowing by yourself?\" He laughed puzzled. \"I forgot all about it; that is finally no misfortune. \"</p><p>\"I'm used to keeping my word punctual,\" I answered fiercely. \"But of course I'm used to your making little of it, to wait for you somewhere to know me. If you have so many friends like you!\"</p>",

More serious and loving than with these quickly read things I dealt with my old Italian novellists and with historical studies. My wish was, as soon as possible, philology set aside and study only history. In addition to works about In general history and historical method I read sources and sources Monographs about the time of the late Middle Ages in Italy and France.</p>",
  "page-101": "<p> It was the first time that I learned my favorite among the people, Franz of Assisi, the most blessed and divine of all saints, know more exactly. And so was my dream, in which I see the fullness of life and spirit before me had opened daily, true and warmed my heart with ambition, Joy and youthfulness. In the lecture hall I was taken seriously, a little bitter and occasionally use some boring science. Home returned I with the homely pious or horrible stories of In the Middle Ages or among the cozy old novellists, whose beautiful and comforting world like a shady, dawning fairytale angle enclosed, or I felt the wild wave of modern ideals and passions roll over me.</p>",
  "page-102": "<p> In between I heard music, laughed with Richard, took at the meetings of his friends part, associated with Frenchmen, Germans, Russians, heard strange modern books read aloud, appeared there and there in the studios of painters or attended dinners, in a lot of excited and unclear young spirits appeared and me how a fantastic carnival surrounded.</p><p>One Sunday Richard visited with me a small exhibition of new Painting. My friend stopped in front of a picture that included an alp introduced few goats. It was hardworking and nicely painted, but a little bit old-fashioned and actually without a true artistic core. You look in to any salon enough such pretty little pictures. After all, it pleased me as a fairly faithful representation of native pastures. I asked Richard what the picture was about him dressed.</p>",
  "page-103": "<p>\"This,\" he said, pointing to the painter name in the corner. I could do not decipher the reddish-brown letters. \"The picture,\" said Richard, \"is no big achievement. There are more beautiful ones. But there is no better painter as the one who did that. Her name is Erminia Aglietti and if you are If we want, we can go to her tomorrow and tell her she is a big one Painter.\"</p><p>\"Do you know her?\"</p><p>\"Yes. If her pictures were as beautiful as herself, she would be rich for a long time and would not paint any more. She does it without pleasure and only because she happened to have learned nothing of what they live for could.\"</p>",
  "page-104": "<p>Richard forgot the thing again and came to it only a few weeks later back.</p><p>\"I met Aglietti yesterday. We really wanted her visit the other day. Come on! You have a pure collar? you that's what it looks like. \"</p><p>The collar was clean and we went together to Aglietti, me with some inner reluctance, because the free, somewhat burschikose traffic Richards and his comrades with painting women and female students never had me like. The men were quite ruthless, soon coarse, soon ironic; but the girls were practical, clever and clever, and nowhere There was something of the transfiguring scent in which I remember the women liked to see and worship.</p>",
  "page-105": "<p>Somewhat confused, I entered the studio. With the air of the painters' workshops Although I was probably familiar, but now I entered for the first time Woman studio. It looked pretty sober and very neat. Three or four ready-made pictures hung in frames, one of which was barely underlined on the easel. The rest of the walls covered very clean, appetizing looking pencil sketches and a half empty bookcase. The painter accepted our greeting coolly. She put down the brush and leaned in the painting apron against the closet and it looked as if she would not lose like to spend a lot of time with us.</p><p>Richard made her outrageous compliments on the displayed image. She laughed at him and forbade it.</p>",
  "page-106": "<p>\"But miss, I could have the idea to buy the picture! by the way are the cows on it a truth - «</p><p>\"There are goats,\" she said quietly.</p><p>\"Goats? Of course goats! From a degree, I wanted to say that to me has stunned. It's goats, how they live, so goatlike. ask You mean my friend Camenzind, who is himself a son of the mountains; he will be mine Right. «</p><p>Here, as I listened to the chatter, embarrassed and amused, I felt flown over from the view of the painter and patterned me. She saw me for a long time unbiased.</p><p>\"You are Oberlander?\"</p>",
  "page-107": "<p>\"Yes Miss.\"</p><p>\"You can see it. Well, what do you think of my goats? \"</p><p>\"Oh, they are certainly very good. At least I do not have them for cows Held like Richard. \"</p><p>\"Very kind. You are a musician? \"</p><p>\"No, student.\"</p><p>Further, she did not speak to me and I now found peace, she closed consider. The figure was covered and disfigured by the long apron. and the face did not look nice to me. The cut was sharp and tight, eyes a little severe, hair rich, black and soft; what me disturbed and almost repelled, was the color of the face. She reminded me Gorgonzola and I would not have been surprised, green ones To find cracks in it. I had never seen this Welsh paleness and now, in the unfavorable morning studio light, she looked startling stony - not like marble, but like a weathering, very bleached stone.</p>",
  "page-108": "<p> I was not used to a woman's face on his To examine forms, but cultivated in such even more boyish To search more for enamel, for rosy, for charm.</p><p>Richard was also upset by today's visit. The more I was surprised or actually scared when he told me after some time, the Aglietti would be glad to sign me. It's just a few Sketches, she does not need her face, but my broad figure has something Typical.</p><p>Before any further mention was made of this, another little event came out, mine changed my whole life and determined my future for years. One In the morning, when I woke up, I had become a writer.</p>",
  "page-109": "<p>At the urging of Richard, I occasionally had, purely as a style exercise Types from our circle, small experiences, discussions and other things sketchy and as faithfully as possible, also some essays about Literary and historical written.</p><p>One morning, when I was still in bed, Richard joined me put thirty-five francs on my comforter. \"It's yours,\" said he in business tone. At last, when I exhaust all questions in questions He pulled a newspaper from his pocket and showed me one reprinted of my little short stories. He had several of my manuscripts written off, brought to a friendly editor and in all Silence sold for me. The first thing printed was the fee I held it in my hands.</p>",
  "page-110": "<p>I was never so strange to courage. Actually, I was angry with Richards Providence games, but the sweet first penmanship and the nice money and the thought of a possible little literary glory was stronger and finally prevailed.</p><p>In a café my friend brought me together with the editor. He begged, to keep the other work shown to him by Richard and invited to send him new ones every now and then. It is a separate tone in mine Things, especially in the historical, which he likes to get more and the he wants to pay me properly. Now I first saw the importance of Thing. I would not only eat properly every day and my little ones Pay debts, but also throw away compulsory education and maybe soon, working on my favorite field, all of my own purchases be able to live.</p>",
  "page-111": "<p>For the time being I got a pile of new books from that editor Review sent to the house. I ate through and had weeks to do with; but since the fees were due only at the end of the quarter and I had lived better than usual in view of them, I saw One day the last rappen unmarried and could once again one Go hunger cure. For a few days I had bread and coffee in mine Shut up, then hunger drove me to a dining hall. I took three from the review books to leave them as a pledge for the bill. At the Antiquar I had tried to install them in vain. The food was Excellent, with the black coffee but I was a little anxious about the heart. I tentatively confessed to the waitress, I had no money, but I wanted to Leave books as a pledge. She took one of them, a volume of poetry, in the hand, flipping around curiously, asking if they read that should. She likes to read but can never come to books.</p>",
  "page-112": "<p> I felt that I was rescued and suggested to her that the three volumes should be sent to to keep the food. She responded and gradually took me for seventeen francs of books were taken that way. For smaller ones For example, I claimed a cheese with bread for poetry books, and the same for novels with wine, individual short stories were only a cup of coffee with bread. So far I remember, it was usually small things in spasmodically newfangled Style and the good-natured girl like from modern German literature have received a strange impression. I remember with pleasure that mornings, when I swiftly sweat in my face The band galloped to the end and wrote a few lines about it to him Have lunch ready and get something edible for it. In front Richard, I was trying to hide my troubles carefully since I am unnecessarily embarrassed and reluctant to relieve his help and always only for very short deadlines.</p>",
  "page-113": "<p>I did not think so for a poet. What I occasionally wrote was Features page, not seal. Silently, however, I wore the secret Hope it will be given to me one day a seal too create, a big, bold song of yearning and life.</p><p>The cheerfully clear mirror of my soul was sometimes of some sort Melancholy shadows, but in the meantime not seriously disturbed. she came sometimes for a day or a night, as a dreaming, reclusive Grief, disappeared again without a trace and returned after weeks or months back. I gradually became accustomed to her as to a familiar friend and did not feel it agonizing, but only as a restless weariness, that had his own candy. If she attacked me at night, I lay down Sleeping for hours in the window, saw the black lake on the sky shaded silhouettes of mountains and above the beautiful sky Stars.</p>",
  "page-114": "<p> Then, often, an anxious sweet, strong feeling seized me, as if I saw it all this nocturnal beauty me with a fair reproach. As The stars, the mountains and the sea yearned for one who loved their beauty and that Understand and express the suffering of their mute existence, and as if I were this one and as if this were my true profession, the dumb nature in Seals to give expression. In which way that would be possible about it I never thought, but only felt the beautiful, serious night impatiently waiting for me in mute desire. Also, I never wrote anything in such mood. But I sensed a feeling against those dark voices of responsibility and usually went on such nights multi-day lonely hikes on. It seemed to me that I could handle the earth, the in silent supplication offered me a little love over which I then laughed myself again.</p>",
  "page-115": "<p> These walks became one Basis of my later life; a large part of the years since then I spent as a hiker, on week and month long tours through several countries. I got used to it, with little money and a piece Bread in your pocket to march far, lonely for days on the road and often to spend the night outdoors.</p><p>I had completely forgotten the painter about the writing. There came She said, \"A few friends and girlfriends will join us on Thursday Be tea with me. Please come as well and bring your friend with you. \"</p><p>We went and found a small artist colony together. There were almost nothing but the famous, forgotten, unsuccessful, something for me There was something touching, although everyone seemed happy and content. You got Tea, sandwich, ham and salad.</p>",
  "page-116": "<p> Since I did not find any acquaintances there and was not talkative anyway, I gave in to my hunger and ate about one for half an hour quiet and enduring, while the others only tea sipped and chatted. As these now, one after another, a little too wanted to access it, it turned out that I almost all the ham stock had eaten alone. I had been of the false belief that it stood at least a second plate in reserve. Since they laughed softly now and I took some ironic looks, I became angry and cursed the Italian woman with her ham. I got up and apologized a short time with her, explained another time to bring my own dinner want, and grabbed my little hat.</p><p>Then the Aglietti took the hat from my hand and looked at me astonished and calm and seriously asked me to stay.</p>",
  "page-117": "<p> The light fell on her face a floor lamp, moderated by the flower umbrella, and there I saw in the middle of my annoyance with suddenly comprehending eye the wonderful, mature Beauty of this woman. I suddenly seemed very naughty and stupid and sat down in a far-off corner like a modest schoolboy. There I stayed and leafed through an album from Lake Como. The others drank tea, went back and forth, laughed and talked, and Somewhere in the background you could hear violins and a cello. A curtain was beaten back and you saw four young people in front of improvised Desks, ready to perform a string quartet. In this For a few moments the painter came to me and put a cup of tea in front of me Tables, nodded benignly to me and took a seat next to me.</p>",
  "page-118": "<p> The quartet started and lasted a long time, but I heard nothing about it, but amazed round eyes the slender, fine, nicely dressed lady, at whose Beauty I doubted and whose supplies I had eaten. With I remembered the joy and fear that she had drawn me want. Then I thought of Rosi Girtanner, the ascent of the Alpenrosenwand, to the story of the Snow Queen, which all of me now only as a preparation for this present moment appeared.</p><p>When the music was over, the painter did not go as I feared had, gone again, but sat quietly and started chatting with me at. She congratulated me on a novella that she saw in the paper would have. She joked about Richard and some young girls and his carefree laughter sometimes crowded out all the other voices About sounded. Then she asked again to draw me. I had one Incidence.</p>",
  "page-119": "<p> Suddenly I continued the conversation Italian and reaped not only a happy surprised look of their lively Southern eyes, but had the delicious enjoyment they speak their language to hear the language of her mouth and her eyes and her figure corresponded, the lukewarm, elegant, quick-flowing lingua Toscana with a delightful light touch of Ticino. I myself neither spoke nice still flowing, but it did not bother me. I should change tags come to be drawn by her.</p><p>\"A rivederla,\" I said as I said goodbye and bowed so low could.</p><p>\"A rivederci domani,\" she smiled and nodded.</p><p>From her house I walked on and on until the street one Hill crest reached and suddenly the dark land beautiful and nocturnal with before rested. A single boat with a red lantern stroked the lake and threw it a few flickering scarlet fringes on the black water from which otherwise only here and there an isolated narrow wave crest with thin, silver-colored outline emerged.</p>",
  "page-120": "<p> In a nearby garden was Mandolinenspiel and laughter. The sky was almost halfway over and over the hills was a strong, warm wind.</p><p>And like the wind the branches of the fruit trees and the black crowns of the Chestnuts caressed, stormed and bowed, moaning and laughing and trembling, so the passion played with me. On the crest of the hill I knelt, lay down on the ground, jumped up and groaned, stomped the Boden threw off my hat, burrowing in the grass, shaking the tree trunks, cried, laughed, sobbed, raged, was ashamed of me, was blissful and killed. After an hour everything was exhausted and in me stifled a dull sultriness. I thought nothing, decided nothing, felt Nothing; I walked down the hill, wandering halfway through it City, saw a late small tavern in a remote street open, entered without will, drank two liters Vaud and came against Tomorrow terribly drunk home.</p>",
  "page-121": "<p>The following afternoon Miss Aglietti was quite startled when I joined you came.</p><p>\"What about you? Are you ill? You look completely destroyed. \"</p><p>\"Nothing of interest,\" I said. \"It seems to me, I was very much tonight drunk, that's all. Please start! \"</p><p>I was put on a chair and asked to keep quiet. That did Me too, for I was soon slumbering in and having that whole Overslept in the studio in the afternoon. It probably came from the smell of turpentine the painting workshop, that I dreamed, our neighbor would be home freshly painted. I lay in the gravel next to it and saw my father with pot and Handle the brush; even the mother was there and when I asked her if she was because she had not died, she said softly, \"No, because if I'm not Well, you'd end up being the same lump as your dad. \"</p>",
  "page-122": "<p>When I awoke, I fell off the chair and found myself in astonishment Workshop of Erminia Aglietti.

Did I sleep long? \"</p><p>\"Four hours. Do not feel ashamed?\"</p><p>\"Oh yes. But I had such a beautiful dream. \"</p><p>\"Do tell!\"</p><p>\"Yes, if you come out and forgive me.\"</p>",
  "page-123": "<p>She came out, but she wanted to wait with the forgiveness until I had told my dream. So I told, and about the dream counting I went deep into the forgotten childhood and when I fell silent and it had already become completely dark, I had mine and myself mine whole childhood story told. She shook my hand and stroked it crumpled skirt, one invited me to draw again tomorrow come and I felt that they also understood my today's bad manners and forgave.</p><p>In the next few days I sat her hour by hour. It was almost done Nothing talked, I sat or stood quietly and enchanted, heard the soft line of charcoal, soaked in the light oil color smell and I had no other sensation than that I was close to the one I loved Woman was and her eyes constantly rested on me.</p>",
  "page-124": "<p> The White Studio light flowed on the walls, a few drowsy flies blew the slices and next door in the little room sang the spirit flame, because I got a cup of coffee after each session.</p><p>At home I often thought about Erminia. It touched or diminished Not at all my passion that I could not worship their art. you himself was so beautiful, kind, clear and sure; what did her pictures do to me? at? Rather, I found something heroic in her diligent work. The woman in the fight for life, a quiet, tolerant and brave heroine. By the way, there There is nothing more unsuccessful than thinking about someone you love. Such trains of thought are like certain folk and soldiers songs, in which a thousand things happen, but the refrain stubbornly returns, too where he does not fit at all.</p>",
  "page-125": "<p>So is the picture of the beautiful Italian woman that I remember wear, not unclear, but without the many small lines and Traits that are often seen much better on strangers than on loved ones. I Do not remember what hairstyle she wore, how she dressed, and so on. not even if she was tall or short. When I turn on she thinks I see a dark-haired, noble-shaped woman's head few keen, not very big eyes in a pale, vibrant Face and a perfectly beautifully curved, narrow mouth from herber Maturity. When I think of her and all that time in love, then I always remember only that evening on the hill, where the warm wind billowed over and where I cried, cheered and berserkerte. And another In the evening, of which I want to tell now.</p>",
  "page-126": "<p>I realized that I kind of confess to the painter and to advertise. If she had stood far from me, I would have her quietly revered and secretive pain suffered around her.

It was by the lake, in a pretty garden, a mature, mellowly lukewarm midsummer evening. We drank wine and ice water, heard him Music too, looking at the red paper lamps in long garlands hung between the trees. It was chatted, ridiculed, laughed and finally sung. Some lousy young painter played the Romantic, wore a bold beret, lay back on the railing stretched out and dabbled with a long-necked guitar.</p>",

Of the women, a few younger ones were in light Summer dresses appeared, the others drifted in the usual way Loosen around costumes. In particular, I found an older, ugly one Student disgusted, wearing a straw hat for men hair cut, smoking cigars, drinking wine and talking loudly and a lot. Richard was as usual with the young girls. I was despite cool with all the excitement, drank little, and waited for the Aglietti, the me had promised to be rowed by me today. She came, too gave me a few flowers and climbed with me in the small boat.</p><p>The lake was smooth as oil and colorless at night.

The beauty and poetry of the whole evening scenery, the sitting in the boat, the stars, the calm, calm sea and all that scared me, because it seemed to me like a beautiful theater decoration, in the middle of which I am a sentimental scene must act.

Sad and angry, I rowed on. After a while, I asked her to tell me something about her life.</p><p>\"What do you want to hear?\"</p><p>\"Everything,\" I said. \"Preferably a love story. Then I tell After you also one of me, my only one. She is very short and beautiful and will amuse you. \"</p>",

Unfortunately, I can not do that. Your poets are used to, for to have all pretty words and those who are less of their feelings talk, no heart daring. In me you were wrong because I do not think that one can love more violently and more strongly than I can do.

We lay up for almost two hours the wide, sloping marble slabs, which a sunny April day quietly had burned through.

It was terrible for me to have to talk about literature or art. I saw that in these areas very little thought, very much lied and In any case, much was talked about unspeakably.

The carpenter was tired, depressed and quiet and seemed to be worried.</p><p>\"Where is it missing, Master?\" I asked when the children were far enough away. He looked lost and sad in the face.</p>",

I'm not a stalker, you know, and just everyone Jubilee once in the church, but I feel that well that now God a word wants to talk to me.

So I told them from the flowers, trees and bushes, that they equal each one of the children Soul and each have his angel. Even the father listened, smiled and ever gave his soft affirmation. We saw the mountains turn blue, heard evening chiming and went home. In the meadows was a reddish Evening breath, the distant cathedral towers towered small and thin in the warm Air, in the sky went the summer blue in beautiful greenish and golden colors over, the trees had long shadows.

I saw him rummaging in the stockpile and knew by himself that he went to the pieces for a child coffin gather up.</p><p>\"It must happen soon,\" he said, \"and I prefer to do it after work for me alone. «</p><p>I sat on a bench while working on the other.

Off the table, against The window, crouched a grotesque, crooked human figure in one Chair that was equipped with a parapet like a child's chair. It was Boppi, the brother of the master wife, a poor half-paralyzed adult, for whom, after the recent death of his old mother, nowhere a cookie had been found. Reluctantly the carpenter had him for the time being and the constant presence of the sick Cripple lay in terror on the disturbed household.

But my fear immediately subsided. Because I am When I had reached the door of the kitchen, I heard singing inside. It was a strange moment. With heart-pounding and out of breath I got up I listened to the dark landing of the staircase and listened slowly the singing of the trapped cripple. He sang softly and a little mournful, a popular love song, \"Blüemli Wiß und red.</p>",

When I recommended Jeremias Gotthelf to him, it turned out that he was his Fonts almost all knew. But Gottfried Keller was still a stranger to him and I promised to lend him his books.</p><p>The next day, when I brought the books, I found opportunity with him to be alone, since the woman just wanted to go out and the man in the Workshop was.

If it really comes once that I have my long-begun poetry completed and given away, there will be little good in it that I do not care about Boppi would have learned. It started a good, enjoyable time for me, at the I'll have plenty to eat my life.

Had a special liking we for the tapir, whose only virtue is not one of its genre otherwise own cleanliness is. For the rest, we found him conceited, little intelligent, rude, ungrateful and highly voracious.

At times, there rose Boppi could not feed the animals himself, a dispute over whether the tapir has had enough, or if he has another piece left. We considered this objectively and thoroughly as if it were a state action. Once upon a time we were past Tapir, as Boppi He said we should have given him some more sugar.
