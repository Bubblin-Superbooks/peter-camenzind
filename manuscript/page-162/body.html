<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>After an appointment already made at home, I left Richard for a week alone and enjoyed the noblest and most delicious hike of my Youth, through the rich, green Umbrian hills. I went the Streets of St. Francis and felt him in some hours next to me Wander, the mind full of unfathomable love, every bird and every spring and greeting each hawthorn shrub with gratitude and joy. I plucked and consumed limes on sunny shining slopes, spent the night in small villages, sang and condensed into me and celebrated the Easter in Assisi, in the church of my saint.</p><p>I always feel like these eight days of hiking in Umbria are the crown and the beautiful afterglow of my youth. Every day springs jumped in me and I looked into the bright, festive spring landscape as in God's kind eyes.</p></div> </div>
