<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Our church lacked a more frequent supply of fresh blood and life from the outside. The inhabitants, a tolerably sprightly sex, are almost all closely related to each other and a good three quarters bear the name Camenzind. He fills the pages of the church book and stands on the churchyard crosses, emblazoned on the houses in oil paint or in derber Carving work and is on the wagon of the driver, on the litter bins and read on the boats. Also over my father's doorstep stood painted: "This house was built by Jost and Franziska Camenzind," but left not my father, but his ancestor, my great-grandfather; and if I will probably die once without children, so white me, that again a Camenzind will settle the old nest, if otherwise it still stands there and has a roof over.</p></div> </div>
