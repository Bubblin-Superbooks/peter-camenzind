<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> When I got into conversation with other guests, I was scornful and rough, of course, the people were after. Nevertheless, there were a few few tavern brothers, all already aging and incurable sinners, with whom I sometimes sat for one evening and found a tolerable relationship. It was an elderly roughneck among them, of his sign Dessinateur, a Weiberfeind, Schweigigel and gichter Zecher first Class. When I found him alone in some tavern at night, sat every time a sharp colliery. First it was chatted, joked and on the side a bottle of red beaker, then gradually came to drink in the foreground, the conversation fell asleep and we squatted each other silent, everyone sucked at his Brissago and emptied everyone for his bottles. One was equal to another, we left always refill the bottles at the same time and watch one others half with respect and half with glee.</p></div> </div>
