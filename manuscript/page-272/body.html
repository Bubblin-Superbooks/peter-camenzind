It has pleased me to bring good luck to God, and me I would like to invite you to my wedding on the twelfth of October. His name is Menotti and has little money, but he loves me very much and has already previously traded in fruits. He is pretty, but not so tall and beautiful like you, Mr. Peter. He will sell fruit in the piazza while I'm in the Shop stay. Even the beautiful Marietta from the neighbor will marry, however only a bricklayer from abroad.</p><p>I have thought of you every day and told many people about you. I I love you very much and also the saint, to whom I have four candles to your Have donated souvenirs. Also Menotti will be very happy if you go to Wedding come. If he should be rude to you, I will forbid him.</p></div> </div>
