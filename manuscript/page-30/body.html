<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Mountains, sea, storm and sun were my friends, told me and educated me and have long been dearer and better known than anybody and People fates. My darlings, however, I like the shining lake and the sad pines and sunny rocks preferred, were the clouds.</p><p>Show me in the wide world the man who knows the clouds better and more loves me! Or show with the thing in the world that is more beautiful than Clouds are! They are play and eyebright, they are blessings and God's gifts, they are anger and death power. They are tender, soft and peaceful like that Souls of newborns, they are beautiful, rich and generous like good angels, they are dark, inescapable and ruthless as the messengers of death. They float silvery in a thin layer, they sail with laughing white golden edge, they are resting in yellow, red and bluish colors.</p></div> </div>
