<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> But would the right hour ever come? With bitterness I thought of those modern, nervous gentlemen, who through a thousand artificial stimuli to the artistic work spiked, while in me strong forces were left unused and remained lying. And I was pondering again, what an inhibitor or demon to me in my towering strength Let the soul falter and get heavier and heavier. I had it even the strange thought, me for something, somehow too to understand short-lived people whose suffering nobody knows, understand or parts. It's the devilish thing about sadness that they do not just one ill, but also conceited and short-sighted, yes almost haughty. You feel like the tasteless Heinesche Atlas, who alone is all Pain and mystery of the world has to lie on your shoulders as if not a thousand others tolerated the same sufferings and in the same labyrinth around were wrong.</p></div> </div>
