I felt only a shivering breath of eternity flood through the dawning room and mix with my nature.</p><p>At the last moment, my eyes were already out, I kissed first time in my life my mother cool, withered mouth. Then overflowed the strange coolness of touch me with sudden horror, I sat down me on the edge of the bed and felt that slowly and hesitantly one big tear ran around the other over cheeks, chin and hands.</p><p>Soon after, the father woke up, saw me sitting there and called me drowsy, what was there. I wanted to give him an answer, but I could say nothing, but went out of the room, came as if in a dream in my chamber and slowly and unconsciously put on my clothes. Soon the old man arrived me.</p></div> </div>
