I have, except the mother and the drowned Youth friend, the blonde Agi and my little, crooked Boppi as an angel in the Live heaven. And I have seen that in the village, the houses patched again and both stone tribes are upright again. If I wanted, I would be sitting also in the local council. But there are already enough of the Camenzinde.</p><p>Now I have recently opened a different view. The innkeeper Nydegger, in whose room my father and I have a lot of Veltliner, Valais or Vaud, drips steeply downhill and no longer enjoys his business. He complained to me these days his misery.
