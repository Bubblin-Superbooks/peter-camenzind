<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>What my father had not succeeded at the time, this succeeded now Love misery. It raised me to the drinker.</p><p>It was more important to my life and nature than anything I told you so far. The strong, sweet God became a faithful friend to me it is still today. Who is as powerful as he? Who is so beautiful, so fantastic, enthusiastic, happy and melancholy? He is a hero and Wizard. He is a seducer and brother of eros. He is capable of the impossible; he fills poor human hearts with beautiful and whimsical seals. He made me hermit and peasant king, poet and sage. Empty he has been burdened with new fates and drives Stranded back into the hurried flow of the great life.</p></div> </div>
