With the air of the painters' workshops Although I was probably familiar, but now I entered for the first time Woman studio. It looked pretty sober and very neat. Three or four ready-made pictures hung in frames, one of which was barely underlined on the easel. The rest of the walls covered very clean, appetizing looking pencil sketches and a half empty bookcase. The painter accepted our greeting coolly. She put down the brush and leaned in the painting apron against the closet and it looked as if she would not lose like to spend a lot of time with us.</p><p>Richard made her outrageous compliments on the displayed image. She laughed at him and forbade it.</p></div> </div>
