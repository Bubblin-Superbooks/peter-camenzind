<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It was always my destiny that I care about life and my friends a lot received more than I could give. With Richard, with Elisabeth, with wife Nardini and the carpenter had done so, and now I experienced it that in mature years and with sufficient self-esteem, that I should be astonished and grateful students of a miserable crooked. If it really comes once that I have my long-begun poetry completed and given away, there will be little good in it that I do not care about Boppi would have learned. It started a good, enjoyable time for me, at the I'll have plenty to eat my life. It was granted to me, of course and to look deeply into a glorious human soul about which Illness, loneliness, poverty and maltreatment only like light loose clouds had flown away.</p></div> </div>
