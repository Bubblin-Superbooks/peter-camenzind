<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> People just know that I am Been abroad for years and I am well aware to tell them what a lousy profession I operated there and in how many puddles I stuck; otherwise I would soon have my ridicule and nickname away. So often When I talk about Germany, Italy or Paris, I blow myself a little bit and even in the most honest places sometimes come in some doubt on my own truthfulness.</p><p>And what about so many wanderings and spent years come out? The woman that I loved and still love, educates in Basel her two pretty children. The other one who loved me has become consoled and continues to trade in fruits, vegetables and seeds. The father, because of which I returned to the nest, neither died nor recover, but sitting across from me on his crib, looks at me and envies me for the possession of the cellar key.</p></div> </div>
