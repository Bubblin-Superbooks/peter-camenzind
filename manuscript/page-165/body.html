<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> A little music, a little spirit, a little love, a little vanity - but it was nice rich and colorful like an eleusian festival.</p><p>And went out fast and miserable like a light in the wind.</p><p>In Zurich Richard took leave. Twice he got out of the Railroad car to kiss me, and nodded as long as I could, tenderly from the window.</p><p>Two weeks later, he drowned while swimming in a ridiculously small South German creek. I did not see him anymore, I was not there when he was I did not hear it until a few days later, when he was already in the Coffin and lay in the earth. There I lay in my little room on the floor prostrate, cursed God and life in mean and hideous LÃ¤sterworten, cried and raged. I had never considered mine before The only sure possession in those years had been my friendship. That was over now.</p></div> </div>
