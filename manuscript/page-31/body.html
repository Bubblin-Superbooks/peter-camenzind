<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> They creep dark and slow like murderers, chasing them upside down like raging riders, they hang sad and dreaming in pale heights like Moody Hermit. They have the forms of blessed islands and the Forms of blessing angels, like impending hands, fluttering Sailing, hiking cranes. They float between God's heaven and the poor earth as beautiful parables of all human longing, belonging to both</p><p>Dreams of the earth, in which she her stained soul to the pure Heaven nestles. They are the eternal symbol of all wandering, all seeking, Desire and Heimbegehrens. And as she zag between earth and sky and longing and defiantly hanging, so hang zag and yearning and defiantly the Souls of humans between time and eternity.</p></div> </div>
