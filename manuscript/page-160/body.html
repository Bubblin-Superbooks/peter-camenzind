<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> With a dark shoot the old, saddening desire rose up in me, me in God Breast toss and my little life with the infinite and timeless too fraternize.</p><p>At Rapallo, I wrestled with the tide for the first time, tasting it salty seawater and felt the force of the waves. All around blue, clear Waves, brown-yellow beach rocks, deep still sky and the eternal, great Noise. The sight of the distant gliding took over again and again Ships, black masts and bare sail or the small plume of smoke a distant steamer. Next to my favorites, the restless clouds, I do not know a more beautiful and serious picture of yearning and hiking as such a ship driving in the distance, smaller and disappears into the open horizon.</p></div> </div>
