It was a lighter, windier one Day, shortly after noon. My arms were wide Supported by a parapet, behind me lay the colored Genoa, and below me swelled and lived the big blue tide. Ocean. With dark roar and Unfulfilled desire threw itself to me the eternal and immutable and I felt something inside me with that blue, foamy tide befriended for life and death.</p><p>Equally powerful was the wide sea horizon. Again I saw how in Kids times the scent-blue distance like an open gate waiting for me. And again, I felt that I was not living a steady life at home among people and in cities and homes, but to wander through foreign lands and born on stray seas.</p></div> </div>
