And I turned around, left the frock coat at home and visited the Carpenter. The workshop was already closed and dark, I stumbled through a dark hallway and a narrow courtyard, climbed in the back house up and down the stairs and finally found one at a door written sign with the master's name. Entering I arrived directly in a very small kitchen, where a skinny woman prepared the dinner and At the same time, he had to watch over three children, who gave life to the narrow space and a considerable roar.
