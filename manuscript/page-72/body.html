<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> It did not occur to me that I had to wake the father, who was sleeping next door with hard breathing. So I knelt for nearly two hours and saw my mother suffer death. She suffered him quietly, solemnly and bravely, as befitted her manner, and has me given a good example.</p><p>The little room was quiet and slowly filled with the light of the ascending morning; House and village lay asleep and I had leisure to accompany in mind the soul of a dying person, over house and village and Lake and snow peaks in the cool freedom of a pure In the early morning sky. I felt little pain, because I was full Amazement and awe to watch how a big puzzle solved itself and how the ring of a life closed with a slight trembling. Also was the plaintive bravery of the departing so sublime, that of their harsh Glory a cool clear beam also fell into my soul.</p></div> </div>
