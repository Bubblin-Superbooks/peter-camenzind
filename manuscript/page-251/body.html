<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Now I finally realized that I have my beautiful landscapes with people people and that they are not natural and loyal enough could be represented. There was so much to catch up with, and I'll get it still after today. Until then, the people as a whole were a whole and basically stranger to me. Recently, I learned how rewarding it is, instead of an abstract humanity, to know and to know individuals study, and my notebooks and my memory filled up with all new pictures.</p><p>The beginning of these studies was quite gratifying. I stepped out of my naive Indifference and gained interest in many people. I saw, how much self-evident was left to me, but I also saw like many walking and looking my eyes open and sharpened have. And since a fondness had always drawn me to them, I gave I especially like to and often with children.</p></div> </div>
