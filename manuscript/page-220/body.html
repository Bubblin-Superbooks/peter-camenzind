<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The spirits of the homeland and the spirits of my youth touched me with their pale ones Wings, filled my little boat and imploredly implored outstretched hands and painful, incomprehensible gestures.</p><p>What had meant my life and what were so many joys and pleasures Pain passed over me? Why was I thirsty for the truth? and beautiful, since I was still a thirsty today? Why did I have in defiance and tears for those desirable women's love and pain I suffered, today I again the head in shame and tears to one sad love tended? And why did the incomprehensible God have that to me? burning homesickness for love done in the heart, since he gave me the life of one Lonely and little lover had intended?</p></div> </div>
