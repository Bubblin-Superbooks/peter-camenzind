It just came a short holiday and me was sent home. There I performed all kinds of power pieces daily everything in my opinion in honor of RÃ¶si. I climb a difficult summit from the steepest side. On the lake I made exaggerated rides in the Weidling, great distances in a short time. After such a ride, there I came burned out and starved, I remembered, until the evening without Food and drink to stay. Everything for Rosi Girtanner. I wore her name and praise for remote ridges and never visited crevices.</p></div> </div>
