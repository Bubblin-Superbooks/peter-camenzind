<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It would have been up to me to pass the test, me for the stars to judge and fight on the new ride around the wreath of life and to err. I had the friendship, the love of women, the youth believed. Now they had left one after another, why believed I not to God and gave me his stronger hand? But I was Timid and hesitant as a child, always waiting for that real life, that it would come upon me in the storm, me understanding and rich and on the big wings to meet a mature happiness.</p><p>The wise and thrifty life, however, was silent and made me drift. It sent me neither storms nor stars, but waited until I returned small and patient and my defiance would be broken. It left me mine Play comedy of pride and goodness, look past it and waited until the runaway child would find the mother again.</p></div> </div>
