<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In Frankfurt, I decided to treat myself to a few more travel days. In Aschaffenburg, Nuremberg, Munich and Ulm I enjoyed the works with new desire the old art and finally I made a very harmless stop in Zurich. So far, in all the years, I had this city like a grave shunned, now I strolled through the well-known streets, looking for the old ones Pubs and gardens reopened and could without pain the past think of nice years. The painter Aglietti had married and was said me her address. In the evening I went, reading at her husband's front door Name, looked up at the windows and hesitated to enter. There they started old times to bring me to life and my childhood love woke up half her sleep with a little pain. I turned back and got the beautiful picture the beloved Welsh woman spoiled by no useless reunion.</p></div> </div>
