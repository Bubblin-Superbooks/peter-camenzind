Silently, however, I wore the secret Hope it will be given to me one day a seal too create, a big, bold song of yearning and life.</p><p>The cheerfully clear mirror of my soul was sometimes of some sort Melancholy shadows, but in the meantime not seriously disturbed. she came sometimes for a day or a night, as a dreaming, reclusive Grief, disappeared again without a trace and returned after weeks or months back. I gradually became accustomed to her as to a familiar friend and did not feel it agonizing, but only as a restless weariness, that had his own candy. If she attacked me at night, I lay down Sleeping for hours in the window, saw the black lake on the sky shaded silhouettes of mountains and above the beautiful sky Stars.</p></div> </div>
