And gradually, the more I read and the whimsical and stranger the look down on roofs, alleys and Everyday life seeped, often tentative and oppressive the feeling in I, too, might be a seer and the one spread out before me World is waiting for me to lift some of its treasures, the veil of the accidental and the common, and the discovered by poetic power snatch from destruction and perpetuate.</p><p>Shamefully, I began to compose a little and it gradually filled some notebooks with verses, drafts and little tales.</p></div> </div>
