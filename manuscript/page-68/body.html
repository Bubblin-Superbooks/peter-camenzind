<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The holiday season that followed gave me a bitter taste of life and tore my beautiful dream wings quickly and harshly. At first I found the mother got sick. She lay to bed, talking almost nothing and doing too from my coming no fuss. I was not pitying, but it was hurt me, my joy and my young pride no echo Find. Then my father told me that while he did not object, if I now want to study, but he can not afford me money give. If the small scholarship is not enough, I'll just have to see me to earn the necessary. At my age, he already has his own bread eaten etc</p><p>Even with hiking, rowing and mountaineering, it was not much this time, because I had to work in the house and field and had free half-days I do not feel like it, not even to read.</p></div> </div>
