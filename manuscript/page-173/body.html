<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Torn, thin, tanned and changed inside I came to two Months in Basel. It was my first such big hike, the first of many. Between Locarno and Verona, between Basel and Brieg, between Florence and Perugia are little places I do not go through two and three times with dusty boots am I - behind dreams, of which still nobody has fulfilled.</p><p>* * * * *</p><p>In Basel I rented a Vorstadtbude, unpacked my belongings and began to work; I was glad to live in a quiet city where no one is I knew. Relations with some newspapers and reviews were still in progress Gang and I had to work and live. The first weeks were good and calm, then the old sadness gradually came back, stayed for days, for weeks, and did not pass at work. Who is not at himself has felt, what melancholy is, does not understand that. How should I do it describe? I had the feeling of a horrible loneliness.</p></div> </div>
