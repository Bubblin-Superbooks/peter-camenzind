<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>And I described San Clemente, as it is silent, skinny, and great in the Brand of the summer afternoon lies. Next door in Fiesole you drive industry, strapping straw hats and baskets, selling souvenirs and oranges, cheating on the Traveler or begging her. Farther down is Florence, including one Flood old and new life. But you can not see them both from Clemente. There no painters worked, there was no Roman building, the History forgot the poor valley. But there the sun and the rain fight with the earth, there leaning pine trees laboriously and alive A few cypresses feel like they're in the air with their lumpy tops enemy storm is close, which shortens their barren life to them hanging with thirsty roots. It sometimes drives an ox-wagon from the nearby large farms or a farmer family pilgrims Fiesole, but they are just random guests and the red skirts of the Peasant women, who usually look so quick and funny, disturb here and you she likes to miss.</p></div> </div>
