<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> It came a few sad weeks, as I distrusted, my hopes and Wishes ridiculously exaggerated, a lot of me in the open and loved again half nights at the wine racked.</p><p>On my tables back then had a few bumps of books accumulated, which I would like to keep, instead of giving it to the antiquarian; but there was no room left in my cupboards. To finally remedy, searched I opened a small joinery and asked the master to measure one Bookshelf to come to my apartment.</p><p>He came, a small slow man with careful manners, he measured the Room, kneeling on the floor, stretched the yardstick to the ceiling, stinked a little after glue and carefully noted one number after the other inch-sized digits in his notebook. By chance it happened that he joined fiddling with a chair laden with books. A few Volumes fell and he bent down to pick them up.</p></div> </div>
