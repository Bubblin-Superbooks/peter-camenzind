<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> It was a memorable day for us when the boat was at one windy late summer morning for the first time to go to sea. My dad, in shy notion of a possible disaster, kept away and had too to my great sadness forbidden to ride. The son of the baker Füßli accompanied the sailing artist alone. But the whole village stood up our gravel place and in the garden and lived the unprecedented spectacle at. Downwind blew a brisk east wind. In the beginning Beck had to row, until the boat got into the breeze, its sail blew and proudly ran away. We watched it admiringly vanish around the next promontory and We set our sights on winning the clever uncle on his return home to welcome and to be ashamed of our sneering after thoughts.</p></div> </div>
