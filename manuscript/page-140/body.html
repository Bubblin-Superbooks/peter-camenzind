<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Well, I have to tell you first.</p><p>It happened that I could spend hours cheerful and forgetful of myself, studied, wrote and listened to Richard's music. But no day went completely without Sorrow over. Sometimes it only came to me at night when I was in bed groaned and bucked and slept late in tears. Or did it awaken when I met Aglietti. But mostly in the late afternoon, when the beautiful, balmy, tired summer evenings began. then I went to the lake, took a boat, rowed me hot and tired and then found it impossible to go home. So in a pub or in one Beer garden. So I tasted different wines, drank and brooded and was sometimes on the following day, half-ill, dozens of them attacked me ghastly misery and disgust that I decided never to drink anymore. And then I went back and drank.</p></div> </div>
